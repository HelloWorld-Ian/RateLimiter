# RateLimiter
&emsp;&emsp;It's a simple, useful and effective rate limiter based on java <br>

&emsp;&emsp;This project implements two rate limiting strategies, one is time window, and another is token bucket, you can easily switch between the two strategies based on your needs. <br>

&emsp;&emsp;You can use this tool by referring to the single test, and you can use it with basic api or redis. If the target of rate limiting is a cluster, I suggest you use redis with this tool to do the rate limit. <br>

&emsp;&emsp;If you have any proposal, please pull request or just leave you comment :)
